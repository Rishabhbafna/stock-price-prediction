## Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data for predicting movement in stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL)

### Project Description:

This project is about analyzing social media data about Apple Inc. and predicting its future stock trend with sentiment classification.
We applied sentiment analysis and machine learning principles to discover the possible effect of "public sentiment" on "market trends".

Prediction of stock price is an extremely  complex and  very  challenging task  because there are  too  many  factors  involved  such  as  economic circumstances,  political  events,  and  other  environmental factors which may impact the stock price. Due to these factors, it is difficult to find out the dependence of a single factor on future prices and trends.
